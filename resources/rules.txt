    OVERVIEW

    Solitaire is a card game for 1 person.
    The goal of the game is to get all the cards from the stock pile into the foundation piles.

    There are several Solitaire variations like spider solitaire and Klondike solitaire.
    While the different Solitaire game rules may change, most follow the same objective.

    SETUP
    Flip the first card atop the stockpile over so that it is face up on the table.
    Deal another six cards, this time face down, in line with the first card that was flipped over.
    This creates the seven piles of playing cards that are the column tableau necessary to play.
    From there deal one card face up on the remaining columns,
    one by one so that the first column consist of one card face up and the last column has six cards
    face down and one card face up. Use the image below for reference as to how the initial setup should look.

    GAMEPLAY
    There are two acceptable ways of dealing cards from the stockpile.
    You can flip cards from the stockpile either one at a time or three at a time.
    Dealing three at a time is the more common way to play.

    So essentially your objective is to move cards around the board to create complete build piles.
    You create a build pile by layering cards of opposite color on top of each other in descending order.
    You are allowed to move around the top facing cards on the tableau as well as cards that are flipped
    from the deck.
    For example, in the image above the black nine of spades can be moved onto the red 10 of hearts
    to begin the consolidation process.
    If you move a top facing card onto another top facing card on the tableau
    you can then go back a flip over the underlying card from the column in which you moved from.

    BUILD PILES
    A build pile starts with an ace and ends with a king.
    Cards can be moved from the tableau to the build pile when there is no other card on top of them
    and they are next in order of hierarchy. For example,
    in the image above the ace of hearts can be moved up to start the build pile,
    the two of hearts can then be moved on top of it as it is next in the order of sequence.
    Notice that the ace leaves an empty space on the tableau,
    only a king can be moved onto an empty space such as this,
    and when moved, all the cards on top of it must be moved over as well.

    You are only required to use cards from the stock when you run out of moves in your columns.
    If you choose to deal three cards at a time, also called the waste pile,
    you can only use whichever drawn card is on top and work your way down.
    If you are stuck even after dealing from the deck, you can deal yourself three more cards,
    replacing the previously dealt cards at the bottom of the deck in the same order.
    You must continue to only use the top most card and work your way down.



    END OF GAME
    You have successfully won the game of solitaire when all cards have been removed from the tableau
    and successfully placed on the build piles.

    VEGAS RULES (VEGAS SOLITAIRE)
    ______________________________________________________________________________________________
    This is a version of the Klondike Solitaire, but with some constraints.
    The same rules for moving cards apply. You can read the Klondike rules on the


    The main constraint is that you can browse the Stock pile only once.
    Once you reach the end of the Stock pile and that’s it. The game is over.

    The Vegas Solitaire game is all about the Dollar score. You can find the dollar score below the game,
    on the right.

    When you start a new game, your score is reduced by 52 USD.
    When you move a card to a Foundation pile, you get +5 USD.
    Your score is saved in a browser cookie. So, if you visit our site again,
    your previous result is going to be preserved. Of course,
    it will be reduced by 52 USD for the new game that is started automatically.

    The game goal is to move as many cards as possible to the Foundation piles.
    More moved cards mean more dollars earned.
    The ultimate goal is to move all the cards to the Foundation piles,
    but since you can browse the Stock pile only once, this happens rather rarely.

    Don’t get frustratred! It’s just a fun game!
